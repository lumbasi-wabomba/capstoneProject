*   **Personal Profiles:** Each user has a profile showing their projects, tasks, notifications, schedules, and uploaded files.

### **Project Organization**
*   **Create & Manage Projects:** Easily set up new projects with a title and description.
*   **Team Collaboration:** Add multiple **members** to a project, fostering teamwork.
*   **Visibility Control:** Mark projects as **public** (visible to all) or **private** (visible only to members).
*   **Creator Ownership:** The project creator is automatically added as a member and has administrative control.

### **Task & Workflow Management**
*   **Detailed Task Creation:** Define tasks with titles, descriptions, and assign them to specific users.
*   **Priority Levels:** Categorize tasks by **Low, Medium, or High priority** to focus on what matters most.
*   **Status Tracking:** Monitor task progress with clear statuses: **To Do, In Progress, and Done**.
*   **Due Dates:** Set **due dates** to ensure timely completion (the system prevents setting dates in the past!).

## 3. Technologies Under the Hood

UniCollab is built using robust and widely-used technologies:

*   **Backend Framework:**
    *   **Python 3:** The core programming language.
    *   **Django (5.2.5):** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
    *   **Django REST Framework (3.16.1):** A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django, providing serialization, authentication, and viewset functionalities.
*   **Database:**
    *   **MySQL:** The primary relational database used for production environments, ensuring data integrity and scalability.
    *   **SQLite:** Used for development and testing, offering a lightweight, file-based database solution.
*   **Other Key Libraries:**
    *   `django-filter`: Simplifies filtering data in API views.
    *   `asgiref`: ASGI support for Django.
    *   `sqlparse`: A non-validating SQL parser.

## 4. Getting Started (For Developers)

Follow these steps to set up UniCollab on your local machine for development or testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Python 3.8+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **MySQL Server**: If you plan to use MySQL as your database. Instructions vary by OS.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/unicollab.git # Replace with actual repo URL
    cd unicollab
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):**
    A virtual environment isolates your project's dependencies from other Python projects.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    With your virtual environment active, install all required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Database Setup

UniCollab is configured to use MySQL by default.

1.  **Create a MySQL Database and User:**
    Log in to your MySQL server and create a database and a user for UniCollab.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE unicollab CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
    CREATE USER 'unicollab'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#Kenya@2025'; 
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON unicollab.* TO 'unicollab'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
    **Security Note:** The password `#Kenya@2025` is a placeholder from the `settings.py`. **You MUST change this to a strong, unique password** for any production deployment.

2.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    These commands create the necessary tables in your database based on the models defined in the project.
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations unicollab
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

3.  **Create an Admin User:**
    This user will have access to the Django admin panel (`/admin/`) where you can manage data directly.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up your admin username, email, and password.

### Running the Server

Start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
The API will now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can test it using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or directly from your browser for GET requests.

## 5. API Usage (For Developers & Integrators)

This section provides an overview of how to interact with the UniCollab API.

### Authentication

All sensitive API endpoints require **Token Authentication**.

1.  **Register:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `POST /register/`
    *   **Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
            "username": "newuser",
            "email": "newuser@example.com",
            "first_name": "New",
            "last_name": "User",
            "password": "strongpassword123",
            "password2": "strongpassword123"
        }
        ```
    *   **Response:** Returns user details and your `token`.

2.  **Login:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `POST /login/`
    *   **Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
            "username": "newuser", 
            "password": "strongpassword123"
        }
        ```
    *   **Response:** Returns your `token`.

3.  **Using the Token:**
    For all subsequent authenticated requests, include the token in the `Authorization` header:
    `Authorization: Token <YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN_HERE>`

4.  **Logout:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `POST /logout/`
    *   **Headers:** `Authorization: Token <YOUR_CURRENT_TOKEN>`
    *   **Effect:** Invalidates your current token.

### Core API Endpoints

UniCollab uses Django REST Framework's `DefaultRouter` to provide standard RESTful endpoints.

*   **Users:** `/users/`
    *   `GET /users/`: List all users (admin) or your own profile (authenticated user).
    *   `GET /users/me/`: Get details of the currently authenticated user.
*   **Projects:** `/projects/`
    *   `GET /projects/`: List projects you are a member of or created.
    *   `POST /projects/`: Create a new project.
    *   `GET /projects/{id}/members/`: Get all members of a specific project.
*   **Tasks:** `/tasks/`
    *   `GET /tasks/`: List tasks assigned to you or public tasks.
    *   `POST /tasks/`: Create a new task.
    *   `POST /tasks/{id}/assign/`: Assign an existing task to a user.
    *   **Filtering:** Add `?status=to_do` or `?priority=high` to filter tasks.
*   **Schedules:** `/schedules/`
    *   `GET /schedules/`: List schedules you created.
    *   `POST /schedules/`: Create a new schedule/event.
*   **Resources:** `/resources/`
    *   `GET /resources/`: List public resources or resources you uploaded.
    *   `POST /resources/`: Upload a new resource.
*   **Notifications:** `/notifications/`
    *   `GET /notifications/`: List your notifications.
    *   **Filtering:** Add `?type=reminder` to filter notifications by type.
*   **Messages:** `/messages/`
    *   `GET /messages/`: List messages from projects you're in, or messages you sent.
    *   `POST /messages/`: Send a new message within a project.

### Understanding the Code Flow (For Deeper Dive)

The UniCollab API follows a standard Django REST Framework (DRF) pattern, which is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern (though Django often refers to it as MVT - Model-View-Template, for APIs it's closer to MVC).

1.  **Models (`unicollab/models.py`): The Data Blueprint**
    *   This is where the **structure of your data** is defined. Each class here (e.g., `User`, `Project`, `Task`) corresponds to a table in your database.
    *   They define fields (like `title`, `description`, `due_date`) and relationships between different pieces of data (e.g., a `Task` belongs to a `Project`, a `Project` has many `members`).
    *   **Example:** The `Task` model defines its `priority` and `status` using predefined choices, ensuring data consistency.

2.  **Serializers (`unicollab/serializers.py`): Data Translators**
    *   Serializers act as **translators** between complex Django model objects and simple data formats like JSON (which APIs use).
    *   They convert data from your database into a format that can be sent over the internet, and vice-versa.
    *   They also perform **data validation**. For instance, the `TaskSerializer` checks if a `due_date` is in the past, and the `MessageSerializer` ensures you're a member of a project before sending a message.
    *   **Example:** `UserSerializer` not only translates user details but also includes nested data for related projects, tasks, and notifications, providing a rich user profile.

3.  **Views (`unicollab/views.py`): The Request Handlers**
    *   Views are the **entry points for API requests**. They receive HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    *   They decide what to do with the request:
        *   **Authentication:** Verify the user's identity using their API token.
        *   **Permissions:** Check if the authenticated user has the right to perform the requested action (e.g., only project members can send messages).
        *   **Logic:** Interact with models (to fetch or save data) and serializers (to validate and format data).
        *   **Response:** Send back an appropriate HTTP response (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized).
    *   **`ModelViewSet`**: DRF provides powerful `ModelViewSet`s that automatically handle common operations (create, retrieve, update, delete) for a model, reducing boilerplate code.
    *   **`@action`**: Custom actions (like assigning a task) are defined using the `@action` decorator.
    *   **Example:** When you `POST` to `/projects/`, the `ProjectViewSet` handles it. It uses the `ProjectSerializer` to validate your data, then saves the new project to the database, automatically setting you as the creator and a member.

4.  **URLs (`config/urls.py` & `unicollab/urls.py`): The Address Book**
    *   These files define the **API's address book**. They map specific web addresses (URLs) to the corresponding views that should handle requests to those addresses.
    *   `DefaultRouter` in `unicollab/urls.py` automatically creates a set of URLs for each `ModelViewSet` (e.g., `/users/`, `/users/{id}/`, `/projects/`, etc.), making it easy to expose your API.
    *   **Example:** A request to `GET /tasks/?status=done` is routed to the `TaskViewSet`, which then uses its `get_queryset` method and `DjangoFilterBackend` to return only tasks marked as 'done'.

This structured approach ensures that the code is modular, maintainable, and scalable, making it easier for developers to understand, extend, and debug the application.
